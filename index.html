        <h2>Philosopher of the East</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Allama Muhammad Iqbal</b> <b>(9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) </b> was a philosopher, poet, and politician in
          British India. He is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. His poetry in both Urdu and
          Persian is considered some of the greatest in the history of both languages. Iqbal is also recognized for his
          contribution to the development of modern philosophy, particularly through his concept of spiritual revival
          for the Muslim world. He is often referred to as the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan." Iqbal’s ideas had a
          profound impact on the philosophy of the East, and he is remembered for his poetry, academic achievements, and
          political influence during the period of British colonial rule.
